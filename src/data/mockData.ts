      question: 'How do I choose the right rexine for a sofa?',
      answer:
        'Start by considering how frequently the sofa will be used, who will use it, and how often it will be cleaned. Compare the rexine’s thickness, abrasion resistance, flexibility, surface finish, backing, cleanability, and colour options. For heavily used sofas, choose a material with performance specifications appropriate for repeated daily use.'

      question: 'Is PU rexine better than PVC rexine for furniture?',
      answer:
        'Neither material is automatically better for every application. PU and PVC-based synthetic leather can have different characteristics in terms of feel, flexibility, appearance, durability, and maintenance. The best choice depends on the furniture and its expected use. Always compare the technical specifications of the specific rexine product rather than choosing based only on the material name.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What thickness of rexine is suitable for furniture?',
      answer:
        'The appropriate thickness depends on the furniture design and expected usage. Furniture rexine is available in different thicknesses, and a thicker material is not automatically better. Consider thickness together with backing construction, flexibility, abrasion resistance, tear strength, and the requirements of the upholstery application.'

        'Rexine is widely used for furniture upholstery because it can provide a leather-like appearance while offering a practical surface for sofas, chairs, beds, benches, headboards, and other interior applications. However, not every rexine is designed for the same level of use.',
        'The right material for an occasional-use accent chair may not be suitable for an office chair that is used for several hours every day. Similarly, a residential sofa may have very different requirements from seating used in a restaurant, hotel, waiting room, healthcare facility, or other commercial environment.',
        'Choosing rexine should therefore involve more than selecting a colour from a catalogue. The material’s construction, thickness, backing, flexibility, abrasion performance, surface finish, cleaning requirements, and intended application should all be considered before purchase.',
        'A good selection process begins with one simple question: where and how will the furniture be used? Once that is clear, it becomes much easier to identify the material characteristics that matter most.'

        'Rexine is commonly used as a general term for synthetic or artificial leather materials used in applications such as furniture upholstery. Depending on the product, the construction may involve a coated textile backing and a synthetic surface layer, with PVC being common in many rexine products.',
        'PU and PVC synthetic leather can both be used for furniture, but their characteristics can differ. PU materials are often selected when a softer hand feel and leather-like appearance are important, while PVC-based materials are commonly considered for practical upholstery applications where easy cleaning and everyday durability are priorities.',
        'The material label alone should not determine your choice. Two rexines made from the same broad material category can have very different thicknesses, backing fabrics, surface finishes, textures, and performance characteristics.',
        'When comparing materials, ask the supplier for technical information rather than relying only on catalogue photographs. Check the construction, thickness, width, backing, surface finish, recommended application, and care instructions.',
        'A physical sample is particularly useful because photographs cannot always accurately represent texture, softness, grain depth, gloss, or colour. A sample also allows the upholsterer to evaluate how easily the material folds, stretches, cuts, and behaves during stitching.'

        'Furniture upholstery is exposed to repeated sitting, friction, movement, stretching, spills, dust, body oils, and cleaning. For this reason, durability should be evaluated according to the actual environment in which the furniture will be used.',
        'Abrasion resistance is especially important for high-contact furniture. Sofas, office chairs, waiting-room seating, restaurant booths, and other frequently used furniture can experience substantial repeated rubbing over their service life.',
        'Flexibility is another important consideration. Rexine needs to follow curves, corners, seams, cushions, and other furniture shapes without excessive stress. A material that is too stiff for the design may be difficult to upholster properly and may not perform as expected around highly contoured areas.',
        'Thickness should also be considered, but it should not be treated as the only indicator of quality. A thicker material is not automatically the best material. Backing construction, coating formulation, flexibility, abrasion resistance, and tear performance all contribute to overall suitability.',
        'For commercial projects, request the manufacturer’s available test information and determine which performance characteristics are relevant to the installation. Depending on the application, this may include abrasion, tear strength, colour stability, chemical resistance, cleanability, and fire-performance requirements.',
        'The goal is to choose a material that can comfortably handle the expected workload rather than simply selecting the most expensive or thickest option available.'

        'Different furniture types place different demands on upholstery. Matching the rexine to the application helps achieve a better balance between appearance, comfort, durability, and cost.',
        'For residential sofas and lounge chairs, comfort and visual appearance are often major priorities. A softer rexine with an attractive grain and appropriate flexibility can work well for furniture where users frequently sit, relax, and interact with the surface.',
        'For office chairs, the material should be suitable for repeated daily contact. Seat areas, armrests, and backrests experience constant friction, so abrasion performance and cleanability become particularly important.',
        'Restaurant and hospitality furniture may require even more practical performance because the upholstery can be exposed to food, beverages, frequent cleaning, and high daily traffic. The cleaning chemicals used at the site should be compatible with the selected rexine.',
        'For beds and headboards, the visual finish may have a stronger influence on the selection. Texture, colour, softness, and overall design compatibility should be considered while still ensuring that the material is durable enough for the expected contact.',

        'Once the technical requirements are established, appearance becomes the next major consideration. Rexine is available in a wide range of colours, grain patterns, textures, gloss levels, and surface finishes, allowing furniture manufacturers and interior designers to create very different visual effects.',
        'Consider how the material will look under the lighting conditions of the actual room. A glossy surface may reflect more light and create a different impression from a matte or lightly textured finish. Dark colours can create a premium appearance, while lighter colours may make furniture feel more open but can require more careful maintenance.',
        'Texture also matters. Fine leather-like grains can provide a subtle appearance, while deeper embossed textures can create a more distinctive surface. The texture should suit the design of the furniture rather than being selected independently from it.',
        'Maintenance should be considered before finalising the material. Ask the supplier which cleaning products are compatible with the rexine and which chemicals should be avoided. This is particularly important for furniture that will be cleaned frequently.',
        'For large projects, keep a physical reference sample and record the material specifications and approved cleaning method. This helps maintenance teams use the correct products throughout the furniture’s service life.',

        'The final rexine selection should be based on a combination of application, performance, appearance, maintenance, and budget. No single specification should be considered in isolation.',
        'For a residential sofa, you may prioritise comfort, appearance, flexibility, stain management, and everyday durability. For an office or commercial project, abrasion resistance, cleanability, chemical compatibility, and long-term performance may become more important.',
        'Always request a sample before committing to a large quantity. Check the actual colour and texture, then discuss the material with the upholsterer or furniture manufacturer. They can also assess whether the rexine is suitable for the furniture’s curves, seams, piping, buttoning, and stitching requirements.',
        'For bulk furniture orders, ask the supplier for consistent specifications across the production quantity. Confirm the material name, colour or code, thickness, width, backing, finish, and other important specifications before production begins.',
        'Price should be considered, but it should not be the only deciding factor. A material that is inexpensive but unsuitable for the expected level of use can result in premature wear, replacement costs, and dissatisfied customers.',
        'The best rexine is ultimately the one that fits the furniture and its environment. By comparing material construction, durability, application, appearance, and maintenance requirements before purchase, you can select upholstery that provides a better balance of performance, style, and long-term value.',
        'When specifications are important, always rely on the manufacturer’s current technical data and care instructions rather than assuming that all rexine products behave in the same way.'

        'PU and PVC are two of the most widely used materials in synthetic leather and rexine production. Although they can look remarkably similar, their construction, surface feel, flexibility, maintenance requirements, and performance characteristics can differ significantly.',
        'Choosing between PU and PVC rexine is not simply a matter of selecting the more expensive material. The right choice depends on where the material will be used, how frequently the furniture or product will be handled, the desired appearance and comfort, and the level of resistance required.',
        'For furniture manufacturers, interior designers, architects, and wholesale buyers, understanding these differences can help prevent premature wear and ensure that the selected rexine matches the demands of the final application.'

        'PU stands for polyurethane, a polymer commonly used as the surface coating in synthetic leather. PU rexine is typically constructed using a fabric backing with one or more polyurethane layers that create the texture, grain, color, and finish of the final material.',
        'One of the biggest advantages of PU is its soft and flexible hand-feel. It can closely replicate the appearance and tactile characteristics of genuine leather, which makes it particularly popular for premium furniture, sofas, lounge seating, handbags, footwear, and interior applications.',
        'PU can also be engineered with different grain patterns, surface finishes, and levels of softness. This gives manufacturers considerable flexibility when developing materials for different design requirements.'
